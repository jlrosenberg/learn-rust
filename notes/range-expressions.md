Rust has something called `range expression` which is a way to represent a range of numbers.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/reference/expressions/range-expr.html

Syntax:
```rust
// inclusive on lower AND upper bounds
start..=end

// This represents the numbers 1-100, inclusive of both 1 and 100.
1..=100

```
